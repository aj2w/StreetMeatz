Models - StreetCart, MenuItem, Review

Basically allows user to input their favorite food carts and their respective locations, to be plotted on Google Maps. Other users can then vote up/down those street carts and then add reviews (which can include photos). Menus, phone numbers, twitter handles (for the fancier street carts) can be uploaded as well.
